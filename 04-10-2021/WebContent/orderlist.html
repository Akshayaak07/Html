<p>Dessert  is a course that concludes a meal. The course consists of sweet foods, 
such as confections, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine and liqueur. In some parts of the world,
 such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of a dessert course
  to conclude a meal.<div>The term dates from the 14th century but attained its current meaning around the beginning of the 20th century,  
when "service à la française" (setting a variety of dishes on the table at the same time) was replaced with
 "service à la russe" (presenting a meal in courses).</div></p>
